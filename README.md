Wind Tunnel
===========

What's this?
------------

It's not really done yet, but it's going to be the successor to the webr experiment (https://github.com/thatdutchguy/webr).
A headless JavaScript testing (using Jasmine, https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) tool that doesn't require a browser, but
can simulate the DOM using jsdom (https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).

Output format can be text or html (a la RSpec).

Disclaimer
==========

Don't use this yet. It's not done. There are no tests yet. I hammered this out while attending LSRC V. I'm still figuring 
out this node.js thing and am not sure how I'm going to structure this yet. Stuff will change. Stuff will break.
